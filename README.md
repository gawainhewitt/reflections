# Reflections

This is an interactive sound installation by [Gawain Hewitt](https://gawainhewitt.co.uk/).

Created for the [Wigmore Hall Learning](https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/learning/learning-landing-page) Festival, Reflections, this installation invites you to create new musical sounds by manipulating original audio using a series of specially created effects.

Like a droplet on the surface of water changes a reflection, these effects change the sound in endlessly unexpected ways, allowing for hours of musical play!

The featured Wigmore Hall Learning sounds are: an excerpt of Daniel Fardon's 'Six Movements' performed by the Bloomsbury Quartet at Wigmore Hall, as well as recordings from [Chamber Tots](https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/learning/chamber-tots), [Singing With Friends](https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/learning/music-for-life), [Chestnuts Primary School](https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/learning/partner-schools-programme) and [Come and Create](https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/learning/come-and-create).
