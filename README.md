# Reflections

An online sound installation for Wigmore Hall

This is an interactive sound installation by [Gawain Hewitt.](https://gawainhewitt.co.uk/)

Created for the Wigmore Hall Learning Festival, Reflections, this installation invites you to create new musical sounds by manipulating original audio using a series of specially created effects.

Like a droplet on the surface of water changes a reflection, these effects change the sound in endlessly unexpected ways, allowing for hours of musical play!

The featured Wigmore Hall Learning sounds are: an excerpt of Daniel Fardon's 'Six Movements' performed by the Bloomsbury Quartet at Wigmore Hall, as well as recordings from Chamber Tots, Singing With Friends, Chestnuts Primary School and Come and Create.
